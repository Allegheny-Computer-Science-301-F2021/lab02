### Reflection Questions:

 - **Business**: For e-commerce web site such as https://www.amazon.com, which one (1) metric (plot, statistic or other) would be the most important in making an educated guess about the amount of _potential business activity_ reported by the site? Why?

`TODO`

 - **Social media: For a web site such as https://www.facebook.com, which one (1) metric (plot, statistic or other) would be the most important in making an educated guess about the amount of _usage_ reported by the site? Why?

`TODO`

 - **Campus Calendar**: For an Allegheny College campus web site such as https://sites.allegheny.edu/registrar/fall-2021-academic-calendar/ that shows important dates for the college, which one (1) metric (plot, statistic or other) would be the most important in making an educated guess about the amount of _usage_ reported by the site? Why?

`TODO`

 - Reflect on the metrics and plots that you chose for the previous three questions. Assuming that your responses were not the same for each type of web site, discuss how it is that the goals of the website appear to favor particular metrics for monitoring the use of the site.

`TODO`

 - What metric would you suggest is often included in a report but may be interpreted differently depending on the goals of the web site? Argue why this metric has such different meanings for particular sites?

`TODO`

 - **Hypothetical Question**: Imagine that you are an administrator of the website of a large bank. The site allows account-holders to check balances (checking and savings) and complete other important banking tasks.

 You have noticed that no-one has checked their savings balance in spite of the fact that thousands of people have logged into the site during the last few days. You suspect that something is wrong with the website somewhere.

 Using at least three different metrics available to you from Google Analytics (monitoring your banking website), describe plots and /or statistical evidence that you could show to the website developers to help them locate the problem in the website. Please justify your selections.

`TODO`
